/*
createSlice() – Creates a Redux slice containing the state, reducers, and actions.

name: "counter" – Gives the slice the name counter.

initialState – Defines the initial Redux state:
{ count: 0 }

reducers – Contains functions that define how the state can be changed.

increment – Increases count by 1:
state.count++;

decrement – Decreases count by 1:
state.count--;

counterSlice.actions – Automatically generates the increment and decrement action creators.

counterSlice.reducer – Exports the reducer so it can be registered in the Redux store.

Flow
Component → dispatch(action) → reducer → state updated → component re-renders

For example:
dispatch(increment());
updates:
count: 0 → 1

Redux Toolkit uses Immer, so writing state.count++ is safe even though Redux state 
is normally treated as immutable.
*/
/*
Immer is a library used by Redux Toolkit that allows you to write state updates 
as if you are directly modifying the state, while internally keeping the 
state immutable.

Example:

state.count++;

Immer safely converts this into an immutable state update.
