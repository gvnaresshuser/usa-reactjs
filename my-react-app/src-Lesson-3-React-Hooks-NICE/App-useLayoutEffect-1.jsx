Math.random()
generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
0.1234
0.8271
0.4567
0.9912
Generate a random number between 0 and 1, then raise it to the power of 10.
For example:
Math.pow(0.5, 10)
gives approximately:
0.0009765625

1. React renders JSX
        ↓
2. DOM is updated
        ↓
3. useLayoutEffect runs
        ↓
4. Browser paints the screen
        ↓
5. useEffect runs
--------------------------
useLayoutEffect
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // runs after DOM update
}, []);

It runs synchronously after React has updated the DOM but before the 
browser paints the updated screen.

That's why it is useful when you need to:

measure an element's width/height
read its position
make a DOM change before the user sees the result
prevent visual flickering
------------------------------
useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  // runs after browser painting
}, []);

It generally runs after the browser has had an opportunity to paint the updated UI.

It's normally used for things such as:

API calls
subscriptions
timers
event listeners
synchronization with external systems
